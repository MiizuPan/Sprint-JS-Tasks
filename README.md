# Sprint-JS-Tasks
all the JS tasks go here if i can even find all of them..


#### Task 1: Build a Simple Calculator
path: The JavaScript Odyssey > Fundamentals of JavaScript > Loops(?) > Task
_no instructions or details was available at the time of submission_

#### Task 2: Create a weather app using Fns
path: The JavaScript Odyssey > Functions > Global Built-in Functions
_the instructions given were with API integration and that is not explained in this current chapter and is too advanced currently, thus an alternative is done through all that was learnt up until this point_
